# Dungeons and Dragons

> A console based version of Dungeons and Dragons written entirely in Java
> linked to a MySQL database to store the Hero and it's attributes.

## Brief explanation of the game

- A player (hero) is created or selected from the database
- The gameboard is randomly initialized with enemies
- Hero moves forward on the board and combats enemies when encountered 
- If the hero survives he can restart or quit the game
